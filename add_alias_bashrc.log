#it is quite annoying to type everytime the full path to scratch
#so we can change our bash rc file in a way that we just type the alias

#aliases in bash rc can be used as a shortcut anything

#be very careful when changing your bash rc profile since it is really important


#open file in vim and add the line below with whatever you want to add as an alias in the format alias [name] = [command]
vi ~/.bashrc

alias main='cd /moto/palab/users/apinharanda/'

#then log off and log back in again

#if you then type 

main

#you will be directly in /moto/palab/users/apinharanda/
